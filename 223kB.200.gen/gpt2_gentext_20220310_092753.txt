[LSC] All-Stars - this Friday & Saturday in 26-100! ðŸŽ¥

UP TO $25 CAN BE DEDICATED HERE!

Can I still win prizes if/when IWC registration closes on Friday?

Absolutely! If you are looking to sponsor a SC2 event between now and then, we would love to have you! We are currently looking for foreign players to help out with registration and feed the SC2 schedule (this is currently a bit of an afterthought). We also have some SC2 related emails in the works.
