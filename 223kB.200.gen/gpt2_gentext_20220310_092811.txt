[SQUID BUILDING] $250,000 Research Impact Deadline

tl;dr - join the Stanford Robotics Lab for a $250,000 grant that will study the uses of neural networks in real-time!

The MIT S&P 500 has lost $250,000 since 2004. The S&P 500’s held for most of our lives, and we’ve never been shy about speaking our mind. Join us this week to discuss the future of the S&P 500, and how some of our peers are taking advantage of the opportunities.

In 2004, S&P Capital invested $250 million in two companies: Google and Hewlett Packard. The investment raised $1.7 billion, and the companies’s share price has since gained 34%. S&P Capital now has more than $1 billion in debt, with more than one-third of that on the market.
