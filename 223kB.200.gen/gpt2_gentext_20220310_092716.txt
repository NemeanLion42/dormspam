[MAJOR SPEAKS] FRESH MEET

This Friday at 7PM, we'll be holding a fresh coat drop after school! Come by the booth (Joker Paint booth in the guest lounge) and drop in a couple of minutes to pick up a new coat! 

There will also be a few free corned beef (a favorite of mine), and a couple of dozen chips (a favorite of mine).

The corned beef? No problem! Just grab a couple of them (it doesn't come with a collar) and drop in the next hour or so!

See you there,
