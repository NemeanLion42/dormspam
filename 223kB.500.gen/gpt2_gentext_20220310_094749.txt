Who doesn’t like cookies?

We don’t want you to stop by and buy any of the above, as we’re selling out! Instead, we'd like to introduce ourselves to you -- Flour Sandwiches!

Flour is a delicious filling made from the delicious Flour Cakes we make every day. It’s also one of our most popular cookies - more than 2,000 of which have signed up as of now! Flour is sold out so we'd like to invite you there!

As a community, we want to make sure that everyone who comes through our door has a great time! If you're coming to MIT with a history class or interested in learning about specific classes, please fill out this form to become a Flour member!  If you're coming to MIT with a different history class idea, please fill out this form to become a Flour member!
