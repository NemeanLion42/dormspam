EI (engineering/in-person learning) is a decade-old practice that has spread to other nations. In WW II, it was used to show the Japanese how to fight. In WWIII, it was used to show the South how to fight. In WW4, it was used to show how to win the lottery. In WW5, it was used to show how samurai should be taught. 

In World War II, the use of machine guns was forbidden. In the Middle East, we are still seeing the horrors of the conflict. In 1Q16, we are seeing the rise of the "Make in Iraq" program. This program, which provides food and medical care to 1.3 million people, is a must for anyone who wants to rebuild and expand their own life in the face of persecution and exploitation in the region.

We are so excited to announce that we are partnering with MIT to create a “Embedded Warrior” game that will be used in our upcoming games.
