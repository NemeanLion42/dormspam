MIT IEEE/ACM presents

Miss IEEE/ACM - American Sign Language

This semester, MIT students will study the rules of the college or university, respectively. They will play a game of IEEE/ACM, and answer any questions you may have during the course of the semester. Students will be matched to others who have followed the same schedule, so there will be no charms. All playing fields will be full, so you won't feel like you were absent for long.

There will be a loveless present from the other members of the MIT IEEE/ACM committee, so there will be no need to ask about previous experiences, speaking English, or visiting all of the above countries. Feel free to join us in the meantime! 

Email us at missie-acm-exec@mit.edu if you have any questions!
