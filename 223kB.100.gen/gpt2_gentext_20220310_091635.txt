MIT CHEMISTIC CHEES: OPEN MONDAYS!!

TL;DR: open mondays are OPEN SO YOU CAN CHEES!!!!!!

MIT CHEMISTIC CHEES 

We’re a group of MIT students who bring our love of chilli to events all weekend long. We’ve been to a lot, have met a lot, and have sat through a lot of chilli movies. We’re all different colors, with different accents, different styles, and no knowledge of chilli. We’ve never been to a movie theater, never been to a movie dance, never even seen a pair of Kanye Wests. We’ve never been to a movie theatre, never been to a movie theater dance, never even heard of a couple of song by Kanye. And we’ve never even known how to pronounce the words chilli (indians, fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu), so we are so excited to bring you our first chilli movie!

CINEMATIC CHEES 

If you want to know how our Hong Kong roots inspired a brand new language, and why Han-Ti-Hai from No.1 to No.2 in the national game is so awesome!
