SaveTFP is excited to invite MIT PEI's Huw Huang to join us this semester! Huw Huang is the Chief Technology Officer at PEI and brings decades of experience in the field to lead the team developing, testing, deploying, and deploying PEI's most advanced platform for peer to peer AI. Huw has been at the forefront of introducing peer-to-peer AI to the global community, leading companies like Autodesk, Facebook, and even Google before Huw. Huw is a masterful program manager who has won numerous awards including the IEEE Computer Vision and Autonomous Laboratory Research Prize, the IEEE/AAI Computer Security Innovation Award, the Kenyon Award, and the IEEE/MIT Computer Society Order of Merit Award. As a team, Huw has delivered on the group's commitment to providing a fast, secure, and affordable way for individuals and businesses to access AI’s latest advancements. Unfortunately, Huw is known to have a large following and has been known to play a large role in the spread of misinformation surrounding the 10-minute rule. 

We’re looking for candidates who can help us build a platform for AI researchers, business leaders, security researchers, and others to gain an appreciation of the science, technology, and engineering of AI’s most recent advancements. For those interested in participating in this study, you will receive $15’s compensation for contributing your work (up to $250) to a project of the MIT PEI’s deep learning program.
