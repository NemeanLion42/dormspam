LAS VEGAS - Persian Gulf Songs

Description:

The Persian Gulf is a beautiful land filled with incredible resources. The Persian Gulf is also filled with people with many different cultures. In order to overcome these cultures, we must all sing Persian songs. 

We are a group of Persian Gulf musicians who sing Persian songs all the time. 

We are the MIT PEI/MIT PEI, a student orchestra that consists of 3-4 members.
