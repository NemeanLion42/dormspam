BASIL BAR BY APPOINTMENT

MIT Women's Studies Department is hosting a boba from now until Sunday 21st (MIT MST3K)

with the rally to demand that all women in MIT (and all over the world) wear the "BASIL BAR" T-Shirt! 

Please join us at 5pm
for a boba from the MIT Women's Studies Department!  

Our goal is to make MIT women's studies better (and safer) for women by making them more accessible via street clothes, menstrual wigs, and boba!  

If you're ordering online, please use the code 3ZRWC3CWC7 so you can order from us!
