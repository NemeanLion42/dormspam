[FREE PASSAGES WITH MIT CHILDREN]

Hello Everyone!

I am ordering food and having a nice chat with everyone at MIT!

We are looking for anyone who is interested in the MIT Persian Language (MPL) language.

You can dress up as many times as you want, just like you wanted.

You can also have your burqas (dish mats) every few minutes, but only if you *get* the burqas!

Also, wear a burqa and some type of covering.

Also, wear a size 8 (even though it's too big for you).

Also, donâ€™t wear a burqa on your street.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact mit-exec@mit.edu.
