[MIT Poker Club] Weekly General Body Meetings on Mondays

Hi everyone,




Sincerely,

MBG-3

Friday, Mar 9th | 1-3 pm | Mezzanine Lounge @ Stud

Come join our weekly recurring email discussion focused on the latest poker news and analysis from the Poker Club of the World. 

The purpose of the weekly recurring email discussion is to provide a forum for discussion and research. All levels are welcome, and our committee members will be around to help you learn the rules, improve your game, and analyze hands. And as usual, there will be snacks! Be sure to stop by and bring your friends :)

This will be the last email dorm-spammed and future reminders will be sent to club members only. So if you havenâ€™t signed up for our mailing lists yet, be sure to visit poker.mit.edu and drop us your email. Stay connected by following us on instagram at @mitpokerclub and like our Facebook Page.

Hope to see you there!
MIT Poker Club
