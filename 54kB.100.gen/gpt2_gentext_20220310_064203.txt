MIT Robotics & MechSci

Thursday, 3/10 | Room 2-105 | 8-8:30 PM

Abstract:

MIT Robotics & MechSci is excited to launch our first event focused on the MIT TECHNOLOGY and RESEARCH GATTACA: MIT Hacking Medicine Study Group!

This two-day event introduces MIT Hacking Medicine researchers to a host of cutting-edge technology, including predictive medicine, z-weeding, and cell-based therapies. Participants will have the opportunity to grow their communities by harnessing these new technologies and applying them to health and well-being.

This is an entrepreneurial opportunity to harness the power of entrepreneurship to create a better world for all of us. We’ll be focused on providing access to medical innovation to underserved communities around the world.

We’ll be building on our strong relationship with Amazon.com and other providers of medical and biotech information. This technology revolution is happening at a time when almost every nation on the planet is on the precipice of a global pandemic. For more than a decade, global demand for medical innovation has been piqued by the rapid technological advance of the last decade. In response to this demand, nations such as India, Brazil, and China have come to invest heavily in advanced technologies and infrastructure, such as deep learning and deep learning-powered machines. However, in response to these opportunities, many traditional barriers to entry have been raised. For example, many traditional medical and biotech employers have recently instituted anti-doping and anti-doping anti-doping sanctions; many traditional healthcare providers have been terminated or suspended from their jobs; and many traditional employers have instituted similar anti-doping and anti-doping anti-discrimination policies. As a result, many traditional employers are seeking to hire employees from countries with anti-doping and anti-doping anti-discrimination laws. This moves traditional healthcare providers, patients, and employers alike into an anti-doping and anti-doping environment that disproportionately impacts women and minorities.

This is a dangerous time for traditional healthcare providers and patients alike. As a result, we’ve suspended all of our medical staff members, effective immediately. This comes as a significant blow to our commitment to providing quality, long-term care to patients and their families. As a result, more than 2,000 people have been affected by this devastating news, and our doctors and hospitals are seeing increased calls for medical attention and demand for care. As a result, we are closing our doors to all medical staff members for this difficult time. We’ll be taking this opportunity to deeply regret the swift and devastating news. 

We are especially sorry for the long wait’s before our doors are automatically taken off staff members for this historic time. We are looking at a unique opportunity to drastically change how we operate at MIT and to deeply regret the swift and devastating news.

Sincerely, 

Team WEA
