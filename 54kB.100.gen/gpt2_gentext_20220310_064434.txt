Branching off from the community of MIT Ukrainian students and allies, we have a collection of assorted assorted string bracelets, earrings, and crochet pins, all Ukrainian-themed. Each one is hand-made and filled with loveüíôüíõ

100% of proceeds will be donated directly to the Humanitarian Fund from the National Bank of Ukraine or the Ukrainian Army (your choice!)
