Order Crafts to Support Ukraine

Hello friends!

Want to help support freedom fighters and humanitarian aid efforts in Ukraine? Please consider ordering something from Crafts for someone else! 

Branching off to a stellar 2014 semester, this collection of assorted string bracelets, earrings, and crochet pins features various parts of the Ukraine that were seized during the conflict. The colors vary widely, with some tones representing freedom fighters and others representing criminals. All struck a sympathetic chord with queer students and allies, and with allies of all stripes. Check out the rest of the pins below!
