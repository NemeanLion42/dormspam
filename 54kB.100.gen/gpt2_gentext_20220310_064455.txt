Order Crafts to Support Ukraine

Hello friends!

Want to help support freedom fighters and humanitarian aid efforts in Ukraine? Please consider ordering something from Crafts for freedom fighters and humanitarian aid workers! 

Branching off from the community of MIT Ukrainian students and allies, we have a collection of assorted string bracelets, earrings, and crochet pins, all Ukrainian-themed, ranging in colors ranging from purple to blue. Each one has a unique design and is filled with heart-felt notes that convey your voice and purpose to other members of the Ukrainian community.

100% of proceeds will be donated directly to the Humanitarian Fund from the National Bank of Ukraine or the Ukrainian Army (your choice!)

Order now with this form!
