Order Crafts to Support Ukraine

Hello friends!

Want to help support freedom fighters and humanitarian aid efforts in Ukraine? Please consider ordering something from Crafts for Ukraine! 

Branching off from the community of MIT Ukrainian students and allies, we have a collection of assorted string bracelets, earrings, and crochet pins, all Ukrainian-themed, ranging in color from a dull orange to a vibrant yellow. Each one has a design focused on a specific issue of the Ukrainian Army's Weekly on Ukraine, and each has an accompanying message on the design explaining why the issue is important to Ukraine. The majority of the pins feature captions (“Correctional,“Correctional Black,“Correctional Blue,“Correctional Green, and“Correctional Purple). For more information, visit boston.mit.edu/dynads.
