The Classroom is thrilled to invite you to MIT LGBTQ+ History Month! Join us to learn about the ways in which the world has shaped and shaped LGBT identities over the last 50 years. From the British to the American (AAPI), people have always been different from people of all sexualities. However, around the same time, a new type of person — one who is attracted to women and men alike but also doesn’t want to be attracted to women and men (MFO) — is born.

For those wondering how this could happen, here’s a timeline of events: https://www.mit.edu/events/9659046031

Hoping to throw back to a more "natural" time when people did not have to worry about their bodies as much as they do now? The MIT Human FSC is having its 20th event this week (7pm ET on Tuesday, July 10) from 6pm-8pm! Come out to the Human FSC building to enjoy delicious Brazilian food (vegan options available) and some Asian friends (you guessed it: vegan!). Grab a chair and join us!
