Analytics for a Better World Hackathon April 2nd - Register Soon!

Course 15/Sloan is excited to launch our first Analytics for a Better World Hackathon!

REGISTER HERE

https://sloangroups.mit.edu/mban/rsvp_boot?id=1454178

What: Inaugural Analytics for a Better World Hackathon

When: Saturday, April 2nd from 8 am – 8 pm

Where: Building E51, in person (conditions permitting)

Who: All MIT undergraduates invited (working in teams of two or three)

Why: Learn how to use analytics for good. Learn predictive and prescriptive analytic methods. Win prizes (like iPads, Apple Watches, & more!). Eat (free!) food. Have fun.


The purpose of the Analytics for a Better World Hackathon is to inspire students in how analytics can contribute to the welfare of society. A better world can be created by addressing problem areas highlighted in the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.

Our first Analytics Hackathon will be based on UN Goal 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) with specifically a focus on Diabetes. For this Hackathon, you and your team will tackle the challenge to predict the risk of a person developing Type II Diabetes1 in the next years. During the Hackathon, you will work with de-identified medical claims data, including the medical history of patients as well as other features. You will have the opportunity to tackle this challenge via many interesting angles, such as time-series analysis, linear and discrete optimization, linear and logistic regression, optimal classification and regression trees, deep learning, random forests and boosted trees, etc2. You will experience the entire pipeline from data processing to model building and testing.

Data sets and food will be provided!

Do you want to know more?  REGISTER HERE and bring your passion and enthusiasm to make a better world!

Saturday, April 2nd, from 8am to 8pm at MIT Sloan, building E51.

Questions?: email ugeducation@sloan.mit.edu.

1Diabetes is a chronic illness characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose that can contribute to serious health issues for patients. According to the CDC, 37.3 million people in the United States alone, which accounts for 11.3% of the population have diabetes. In the long term, occurrence of diabetes can significantly damage the heart, blood vessels as well as other organs, leading to for example a two- to three-fold increased risk of heart attack. However, diabetes is also a preventable disease with the help of improved diet and regular exercise. If doctors are able to detect diabetes early on, patients can effectively change their lifestyle to prevent the onset of diabetes.

2 Don’t know what some or all of these words mean? Don't worry. As part of the Hackathon there will be mini classes introducing you to the tools of analytics!

tl;dr Submit your art/writing to Issue Three of the Rooted zine on reflection and get a FREE COPY of the zine!

MIT AAI is looking to feature stories from the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in the third issue of our zine series, Rooted.

 We are looking for art, from visual to written, revolving around the theme of reflection on our AAPI identity.

What, if anything, truly reflects our identities?

Short stories, poems, drawings, photography, and any form of printable art around these themes are accepted,

whether it be through firsthand experience or that of family and friends. All contributors will get a FREE COPY of the zine!

Anyone in the AAPI community who is interested in contributing — whether an undergrad, grad student, faculty, staff, or alumni — is invited to submit. Anonymous submissions are welcome!

~Submit and read more details here by Friday, March 4, 2022!~

Questions? Email aai-exec@mit.edu

Casual Racism @ MIT Strikes Again - New Vassar

To my fellow concerned students,

Yesterday afternoon, a slew of offensive messages were posted on a dorm-wide piazza specific to New Vassar. These messages were made anonymously -- a persona most frequented by racist (flagrant & inflammatory) commentators alike. The posts below were swiftly edited/deleted within an hour. Read with caution; trigger warning. 

As a relatively new dorm with aspirations of being "diverse and inclusive" albeit artificially, this event calls much of those dorm-specific goals into question. The response from the New Vassar President (some of which is attached below) fails to address the messages as racist, sexist, or even offensive, only 'deeply concerning.' The response does not demand that the authors take responsibility for their actions, but only suggests that if the behavior were to continue (perhaps worsen) then some Piazza priveledges would be suspended. It doesn't grant the issue its due diligence by fully confronting the ways in which the rhetoric is harmful to students of color, especially toward Black students.

But this type of racial bias and insensitivity isn't strange to our campus. This has been going on for decades at the Institute. However, more recently, a similar incident happened last semester; read the BSU's Official Response to the Racial Bias Incident in NH3 here. And with no campus-wide initiative to address racial bias sponsored by the Institute (as demanded by the BSU earlier last semester), we can expect incidents of this nature to continue long into the future. And most of them won't even reach a forum like this for discussion, reflection, and reparation. From one concerned student to another, I hope you will support the swift action of our Black Students' Union, in the varied forms it will take. Thank you.

Help break a Guinness World Record!

The current Guinness World Record for the Largest Rube Goldberg Machine is 427 actions. I think MIT can beat that by hitting 500.

(If you didn’t already know, a Rube Goldberg machine is a chain reaction contraption that performs a simple task in a complicated way.)

I can’t do this alone (teams are more fun anyway) and would love your help! Some things to work on:

Building the actual thing (if you did “Mission Possible” in Science Olympiad or something similar, this is definitely up your alley)
Writing up the guidelines on how we’ll run the project
Gathering build supplies
Having tooling and machining access to existing makerspaces
Locating and obtaining a physical space to host the project
Finding and applying for grants (student community, public art installation, and engineering grants are the main applicable ones)
Pubbing the project (creating flyers, making a list of all channels we can pub to, postering, social media)
Public relations (in charge of correspondence with MIT administration, the Guinness World Records office, news outlets, and local charities)
 
I think the plan is to have this completed by the end of the school year with prefrosh helping during CPW for ~100 actions. Happy to hear other timeline ideas.

If you’re at all interested, reply to this email with (1) what you’d like to help with, (2) why you’d be good for it, and (2) your discord username. Excited to be building machines and breaking records with you!

[AI@MIT] Learn the basics of AI/ML @ Fundamentals Reading Group

TL;DR: AI@MIT Fundamentals reading group starting on 3/8, 4-5pm in 2-146. RSVP here! 

AI@MIT Fundamentals Reading Group!

AI@MIT is launching the Fundamental Reading Group focused on fundamental papers of machine learning and deep learning! The goal of the group is to explore the basics of ML research and theory.

We plan to cover themes including methods, architectures, and design choices commonly referenced in modern research and application. This will tentatively include topics such as regularization, dropout, VAEs, and attention.

Each meeting will include a presentation accompanying the paper which introduces the ideas at a high level before a group read-through. This group is focused on students beginning their ML journeys. Our biggest focus is to distill the concepts into an approachable format. We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about the basics of ML to join us.

The topic of the first meeting will be a primer on the field of ML to make sure that everyone is starting in a similar place. This will mainly be focused on an introduction into the basics of neural networks.

Meetings will be held in 2-146 weekly, Tuesday evenings 4-5pm. The first meeting is on 3/8! RSVP here for more details!
