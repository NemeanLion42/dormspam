Analytics for a Better World Hackathon April 2nd - Register Soon!

Course 15/Sloan is excited to launch our first Analytics for a Better World Hackathon!

REGISTER HERE

https://sloangroups.mit.edu/mban/rsvp_boot?id=1454178

What: Inaugural Analytics for a Better World Hackathon

When: Saturday, April 2nd from 8 am – 8 pm

Where: Building E51, in person (conditions permitting)

Who: All MIT undergraduates invited (working in teams of two or three)

Why: Learn how to use analytics for good. Learn predictive and prescriptive analytic methods. Win prizes (like iPads, Apple Watches, & more!). Eat (free!) food. Have fun.


The purpose of the Analytics for a Better World Hackathon is to inspire students in how analytics can contribute to the welfare of society. A better world can be created by addressing problem areas highlighted in the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.

Our first Analytics Hackathon will be based on UN Goal 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) with specifically a focus on Diabetes. For this Hackathon, you and your team will tackle the challenge to predict the risk of a person developing Type II Diabetes1 in the next years. During the Hackathon, you will work with de-identified medical claims data, including the medical history of patients as well as other features. You will have the opportunity to tackle this challenge via many interesting angles, such as time-series analysis, linear and discrete optimization, linear and logistic regression, optimal classification and regression trees, deep learning, random forests and boosted trees, etc2. You will experience the entire pipeline from data processing to model building and testing.

Data sets and food will be provided!

Do you want to know more?  REGISTER HERE and bring your passion and enthusiasm to make a better world!

Saturday, April 2nd, from 8am to 8pm at MIT Sloan, building E51.

Questions?: email ugeducation@sloan.mit.edu.

1Diabetes is a chronic illness characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose that can contribute to serious health issues for patients. According to the CDC, 37.3 million people in the United States alone, which accounts for 11.3% of the population have diabetes. In the long term, occurrence of diabetes can significantly damage the heart, blood vessels as well as other organs, leading to for example a two- to three-fold increased risk of heart attack. However, diabetes is also a preventable disease with the help of improved diet and regular exercise. If doctors are able to detect diabetes early on, patients can effectively change their lifestyle to prevent the onset of diabetes.

2 Don’t know what some or all of these words mean? Don't worry. As part of the Hackathon there will be mini classes introducing you to the tools of analytics!

MIT AAI is looking to feature stories from the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in the third issue of our zine series, Rooted.

 We are looking for art, from visual to written, revolving around the theme of reflection on our AAPI identity.

What, if anything, truly reflects our identities?

Short stories, poems, drawings, photography, and any form of printable art around these themes are accepted,

whether it be through firsthand experience or that of family and friends. All contributors will get a FREE COPY of the zine!

Anyone in the AAPI community who is interested in contributing — whether an undergrad, grad student, faculty, staff, or alumni — is invited to submit. Anonymous submissions are welcome!

~Submit and read more details here by Friday, March 4, 2022!~

Questions? Email aai-exec@mit.edu

Casual Racism @ MIT Strikes Again - New Vassar

To my fellow concerned students,

Yesterday afternoon, a slew of offensive messages were posted on a dorm-wide piazza specific to New Vassar. These messages were made anonymously -- a persona most frequented by racist (flagrant & inflammatory) commentators alike. The posts below were swiftly edited/deleted within an hour. Read with caution; trigger warning. 

As a relatively new dorm with aspirations of being "diverse and inclusive" albeit artificially, this event calls much of those dorm-specific goals into question. The response from the New Vassar President (some of which is attached below) fails to address the messages as racist, sexist, or even offensive, only 'deeply concerning.' The response does not demand that the authors take responsibility for their actions, but only suggests that if the behavior were to continue (perhaps worsen) then some Piazza priveledges would be suspended. It doesn't grant the issue its due diligence by fully confronting the ways in which the rhetoric is harmful to students of color, especially toward Black students.

But this type of racial bias and insensitivity isn't strange to our campus. This has been going on for decades at the Institute. However, more recently, a similar incident happened last semester; read the BSU's Official Response to the Racial Bias Incident in NH3 here. And with no campus-wide initiative to address racial bias sponsored by the Institute (as demanded by the BSU earlier last semester), we can expect incidents of this nature to continue long into the future. And most of them won't even reach a forum like this for discussion, reflection, and reparation. From one concerned student to another, I hope you will support the swift action of our Black Students' Union, in the varied forms it will take. Thank you.

Help break a Guinness World Record!

The current Guinness World Record for the Largest Rube Goldberg Machine is 427 actions. I think MIT can beat that by hitting 500.

(If you didn’t already know, a Rube Goldberg machine is a chain reaction contraption that performs a simple task in a complicated way.)

I can’t do this alone (teams are more fun anyway) and would love your help! Some things to work on:

Building the actual thing (if you did “Mission Possible” in Science Olympiad or something similar, this is definitely up your alley)
Writing up the guidelines on how we’ll run the project
Gathering build supplies
Having tooling and machining access to existing makerspaces
Locating and obtaining a physical space to host the project
Finding and applying for grants (student community, public art installation, and engineering grants are the main applicable ones)
Pubbing the project (creating flyers, making a list of all channels we can pub to, postering, social media)
Public relations (in charge of correspondence with MIT administration, the Guinness World Records office, news outlets, and local charities)
 
I think the plan is to have this completed by the end of the school year with prefrosh helping during CPW for ~100 actions. Happy to hear other timeline ideas.

If you’re at all interested, reply to this email with (1) what you’d like to help with, (2) why you’d be good for it, and (2) your discord username. Excited to be building machines and breaking records with you!

[AI@MIT] Learn the basics of AI/ML @ Fundamentals Reading Group

TL;DR: AI@MIT Fundamentals reading group starting on 3/8, 4-5pm in 2-146. RSVP here! 

AI@MIT Fundamentals Reading Group!

AI@MIT is launching the Fundamental Reading Group focused on fundamental papers of machine learning and deep learning! The goal of the group is to explore the basics of ML research and theory.

We plan to cover themes including methods, architectures, and design choices commonly referenced in modern research and application. This will tentatively include topics such as regularization, dropout, VAEs, and attention.

Each meeting will include a presentation accompanying the paper which introduces the ideas at a high level before a group read-through. This group is focused on students beginning their ML journeys. Our biggest focus is to distill the concepts into an approachable format. We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about the basics of ML to join us.

The topic of the first meeting will be a primer on the field of ML to make sure that everyone is starting in a similar place. This will mainly be focused on an introduction into the basics of neural networks.

Meetings will be held in 2-146 weekly, Tuesday evenings 4-5pm. The first meeting is on 3/8! RSVP here for more details!

[DPhiE] "65 Roses" White Day Grams

TLDR: Order “65 Roses” White Day Grams to support the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation! You can also order as part of an organization to win some exciting prizes! Order form here: https://forms.gle/MhinYFs9RZAHipHb8, if you would like to donate go here: https://my.crowdchange.co/zom5vp.

We are selling beautiful wooden roses to raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), and we would love your support! Over the next week you can order a “65 Roses” White Day Gram for your friends (or more than friends), and all the proceeds will go to supporting CFF. These grams contain wooden roses, candy, teddy bears, and more! Order roses before March 4th using this form!

~Why "65 roses"?~

Children who are diagnosed with the genetic disorder "Cystic Fibrosis" often use the phrase "65 roses" to help them pronounce the name of their condition. Cystic Fibrosis can cause lung infections and breathing issues, affecting over 30,000 children and adults in the US. CFF was co-founded in 1955 by a DPhiE alum and has since increased the life expectancy of those with CF from 5 to 45 years! Learn more about CFF here: https://www.cff.org/

~What is White Day?~

Originating from Japan, White Day is celebrated every year on March 14th. Traditionally, people exchange gifts as thank yous for Valentine's gifts. This year at MIT, you can send gifts and notes to anyone you appreciate while also raising money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation!

~Group Competition~

Part of a FSILG, student club, or other organization? Order as a group! If your organization collectively orders 65 roses we will shout you out on our instagram! For the top three organizations (by money raised), DPhiE will support & publicize one of your future fundraisers/events <3 AND 1st place will get baked goods homemade by us! :) Team pages can be set up on CrowdChange + mentioned on the final page of the order form.

Thank you for your support!

Ultimate Nerf Gun Showdown

Tomorrow, Saturday, March 5, from 8 to 11 PM, on the hallowed battlefield of the 1st floor of Building 36, there shall be held a most epic combat. It shall be the Last Battle Royal, the Skirmish of the Millennium, the Tie-breaking Ritual Combat, the Titular Versus, the Final Fisticuffs Frontier. Indeed, it shall be THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN OF ULTIMATE DESTINY!

Witness the Official Theatrical Trailer:
http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/showdown

The Ultimate Showdown - Albino Blacksheep
Every hero and villian of all time battle it out to the end in this amazing Lemon Demon song. You'll never guess who survives the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny.
www.albinoblacksheep.com

It's a giant asymmetric free-for-all, with every character having different weapons and wacky abilities! Shoot your friends! Make new enemies! Die in glorious combat and live on in Valhalla! And when you're been there and done that, come back and get a new character so you can re-join the fray!

Many will enter the battle, but ONLY ONE WILL SURVIVE! I wonder who it will be? Will Dr. Frank N. Furter blow the Men in Black back to Transylvania? Will the Kool-Aid Man quench the thirst of a Class IV Kaiju? Will the Redshirts outrun Rainbow Dash? Will the Avengers unite to repel the dreaded Sand Worms, or will the Amongus get them first?

Game will start at 8 PM with an explanation of the rules. Latecomers will receive a quick run-down and have a nerf gun shoved into their hands.

This live-action game is being run under the auspices of the MIT Assassins Guild. Wear footwear that you're comfortable running and being active in. As per Institvte policy, face masks will be required.

We look forward to kill you soon.

Write for the MIT Political Review!

Hi all,

TL;DR: Come write for the MIT Political Review this semester! We’d love to hear what you have to say (and we’re sure others would, too).

With the spring semester in full swing, we'd like to introduce ourselves to you. We're the MIT Political Review.

MIT has long been known as a bastion of science and technology, but when it comes time to meditate on the societal implications of the work we do and the world beyond our campus, people look elsewhere--oftentimes to the school down the street. In becoming so consumed by the theoretical and the scientific, we’ve insulated ourselves from the machinations that dominate our state, our country and our world.

We’re here to change that. To create a publication (and a platform) that will help students to nurture their civic spirit, facilitate the conversations that are too often confined to social media, and illuminate the many contours of our institution's political consciousness.

We welcome dissension. We welcome heterodoxy. We're not here to repeat ad nauseam the same, tired punditry that already dominates both your screens and the headlines. We’re here to interrogate our own convictions, challenge the beliefs of our peers, and provide a grounded and analytical voice (in true MIT fashion and rigor) on the most pressing subjects of our day. And we'd love for you to join us in that mission.

If you'd like to write for us, be it on a regular basis or as an ad-hoc contributor, indicate your interest here.

Best,

Chase Reid

March for Trans Youth, Friday 3/4 @ 5 PM, Copley Sq → State House

A week ago today, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, backed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, released a directive to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services essentially criminalizing the act of providing gender affirming care to trans minors. Investigations of the parents of trans children for “child abuse” have already begun. There’s no mincing words: this directive will kill trans children, who are already some of the most vulnerable among us.

We will be marching to demand Massachusetts Governor Baker and other elected officials immediately not just publicly oppose this atrocious legislation, but also take swift legislative action to ensure the safety of trans youth both in Texas and all other states.

I invite every member of the MIT community to join the Queer Occupation Project/June 25th Coalition this Friday, March 4th at 5 PM to march from Copley Square to the State House. Bundle up (it’s going to be cold) and bring signs, flags, noisemakers, etc.

Yours in solidarity,

Hey!

My name is Gyalpo Dongo and I am looking for 2 Spanish-speaking tutors to teach either English or Reading sections for SAT starting on the 7th of March for Incognity Academy!

For the SAT teaching position, the requirements are to have a 700+ in the English SAT Section and to speak Spanish if interested in the SAT teaching position.

We are also looking for students who took the IB to give talks to students and parents for around 2 hours/month to help South American students realize the importance of the IB and how it can help them apply to TOP universities abroad.

For the IB position, the requirements are to have +40 overall in IB and/or 7 in any Higher subject.

The payment would be $15/hour.

If interested, please reply to this email ASAP with your SAT score and/or IB Scores, any teaching experience, and any academic achievements you may have!

[SSOMIT] WED 3/2 @ 5:00 PM: Reasonable Accomodation

What is a "reasonable accommodation" of religion as a civil right? What is the history and precedent of this concept? How is it applicable in different public and private contexts (prison, military, business, school, etc) for different practices (diet, worship, attire, grooming, etc)? Can it amount to a First Amendment violation, and when? How should secularism advocates approach this when it comes to marginalized communities associated with a religion?

WHEN: Wednesday, 2022/MAR/02, 5:00pm~6:00pm
WHERE: W20-450 (4th floor, MIT Student Center, https://whereis.mit.edu/?go=W20) 

We follow a secular safe zone policy for these meetups (recording and photography are prohibited).
Open to MIT community members and guests (as restricted by MIT's public health regulations).

MIT Calendar Event: http://calendar.mit.edu/event/ssomit_weekly_2021F
Facebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/266784678408808/

Weekly hangouts are SSOMIT's regular meetups for nontheist and nontheism-curious members of the MIT community, to get to know and keep in touch with one another, and to engage in discussion of big ideas, current issues, religious scripture, and significant secular texts.

Help MIT ESP build a website

In 2011, ESP’s website won APO’s “Ugliest Manifestation on Campus” contest. 

11 years later, our members, teachers, and students still use the same website every day.

The Educational Studies Program (MIT ESP) is building a new website and is looking for student developers/designers!  

Are you interested in utilizing your web development skills or growing your skills in UX/UI? This is the perfect opportunity to hone your skills while contributing to a final product that will be used by 5,000+ students and 1,000+ teachers each year! Examples of features we are developing include:

Implementing a class lottery algorithm 

Designing a class registration experience for students as young as 12 years old

Doing critical system administration work

If that is not convincing enough, ESP will provide free food every week during meetings and at ad-hoc work sessions.

Ukraine

Hello MIT,

Putin, the Russian president, officially declared war against Ukraine. He started by bombing all major Ukrainian cities at 5 AM when everyone in Ukraine was sleeping. Our friends back home were awoken by neighboring bomb explosions. 

Ukrainians are ready to resist this authoritarian regime. One thing we need right now is the help of our foreign partners. A declaration of war against Ukraine is a declaration of war against all - all who choose to self determine, all who choose freedom, and all who prefer democracy. Ukrainians abroad are requesting funds to support the effort, the links to the fundraisers can be found here: https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/ or here.

We also gather for a rally today at 11am at State House! Join if possible!

The conflict is as real for the United States as it is for Ukrainians. Please understand that lack of action now to help Ukrainians will enable further Russian action in their war against sovereignty. We understand that the Russian invasion may feel like an impossibility. It very much felt like an impossibility to us as well... until 5 AM last night when our friends and loved ones were awakened not by their usual alarm clocks, rather by ballistic missile strikes. Your help in this effort would be so invaluable and appreciated. Small actions lead to big actions.

It may seem like an impossible challenge. Only together can we stand up against authoritarianism. Thank you for your support in advance! 

Best,

Fedir, Sasha, Yevhenii, Vlada, Mariia, Artem, and others

[SSOMIT] WED 2/23 @ 5:00 PM: Religion and Nationalism

Is religion a viable tool to form a collective identity? Why is it that even in many secular countries, religion is a prerequisite for people in power? What is the role of religion in nation building, and whether/how the non-religious are equipped in that regard. Join us this week to discuss religion and nationalism for our fourth weekly hangout of the semester.

The weekly meeting times have changed, from this week on we will be meeting on Wednesday at 5pm weekly.

WHEN: Wednesday, 2022/FEB/23, 5:00pm~6:00pm
WHERE: W20-450 (4th floor, MIT Student Center, https://whereis.mit.edu/?go=W20) 

We follow a secular safe zone policy for these meetups (recording and photography are prohibited).
Open to MIT community members and guests (as restricted by MIT's public health regulations).

MIT Calendar Event: http://calendar.mit.edu/event/ssomit_weekly_2021F
Facebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/266784678408808/

Weekly hangouts are SSOMIT's regular meetups for nontheist and nontheism-curious members of the MIT community, to get to know and keep in touch with one another, and to engage in discussion of big ideas, current issues, religious scripture, and significant secular texts.

As King Arthur shall someday rise from the secluded vale of Avalon to reign once more; as Baldur, Odin's son, shall emerge from half-corpse Hel's domain to rebuild after the ravages of Ragnarök; as our Dark Lord Krotus shall reawaken from the grime of the Charles, spurred by spuds and sodium-flash; so too shall the MIT Laboratory for Chocolate Science rouse from our dismal slumber as the joyous missive spreads across Institvte inboxes like the fiery beacons of Gondor: food and drinks will once again be allowed. 

Untempered by the pall of plague, half-forgotten dreams beta-crystallize into action. The Chocolatiers are back.

Join us in W20-491 from 4-5pm this Two's Day, 2/22/22 to increase MIT's chocolate consumption.

Fondue. Event-planning. ~300 lbs of dark, milk, and white chocolate that won't eat themselves.

(Masks required when not eating chocolate. If you're an alum and don't have MIT's Covid Pass but you'd like to attend, please let me know beforehand to arrange access-- you'll need to be vaccinated and boosted.)

[LAST DAY!] Audition for Next Act's Comeback Show NOW!

Do you like singing? Or dancing? How about acting?

Audition for Next Act's CPW 2022 Show

The Drowsy Chaperone

"Winner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, The Drowsy Chaperone is a loving send-up of the Jazz Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another. Hailed by New York Magazine as 'The Perfect Broadway Musical,' The Drowsy Chaperone is a masterful meta-musical, poking fun at all the tropes that characterize the musical theatre genre." 

Next Act? What even is that?

Next Act is a decades-old tradition! We put on a musical every spring just in time for CPW.  
This show will be Next Act's 36th annual production since 1985!
You can also learn more about us on our website and follow us on Instagram (@nextactmit)!

Sign up for an audition slot here!

Auditions are NOW

until 10pm

in the Next House PDR 

(the room in the back of Next dining)

***We accept everyone who auditions! No prior experience necessary!***  

Auditions are 10-15 minutes long and involve both reading lines and singing. Please prepare a short song to sing acapella for us - it can be anything at all (even Happy Birthday), just not from The Drowsy Chaperone! 

Curious about the characters? Take a look at the character breakdown we made for you!

Questions???

[2022 PKG Fellowships] Summer Is Calling!! Answer it!! [Due March 15th]

TLDR: PKG Summer Fellowships Due Mid-March!!

I don’t know about you.....

.....but I am so ready for the summer....

Some of you may still need plans – and we have a great idea!

Consider a PKG Fellowship!!

Proposals Are Due Tuesday March 15th, 2022 at Noon

Learn more here

Support for big ideas and inspired collaborations.

The PKG Fellowships program supports MIT students working on capacity-building social impact and community engagement projects. Students work with community-focused organizations including non-profits and social enterprises. These can include a student's own social enterprise.

How Fellowships work

Fellowships support your work with community-focused organizations: nonprofits, government offices, aid agencies, schools, for-profit social enterprises, student-initiated service enterprises, and others. If in doubt, ask! Fellows typically receive a stipend, which helps cover living and travel expenses. Each fellowship has its own requirements, however, so explore the options below to find the one that best suits you and your project.

And what do students say?

“As a student I am used to exploring the knowledge that exists in a field, and yes, that means pushing up against the frontiers of what is known every once in a while. But, often there are well known methods that exist for arriving at those next answers, for pushing the horizons a little further. When it came to this project, however, we often found ourselves having to invent our own methodologies, combining numerous sources of research or data and drawing our own conclusions. Through the incredible help of many experts and community partners, we were able to develop ways of conducting the research into many of the trickier aspects of climate change such as politics or finance. Along the way, we have begun to learn how to stretch what is known into what we need to know to make progress as a society on climate change.” – Matthew Kearney

Come Gamble With VSA!

Missed the excitement of losing? Desiring pain but don’t know where to get? Well, here’s an answer. Come join us this Saturday at 5 in 1-134 for some Vietnamese gambling! Don’t worry if you’re broke, we’ll be playing with candy instead of money! This also means that you will feel only momentary pain, unlike your classes… jk…or not. Jokes aside, we hope you can come join us for some fun this Saturday.

We’ll be playing a popular Vietnamese Tet game called Bầu cua. We will teach you the rules, but if you want to get ahead you can find the rules here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bầu_cua_tôm_cá

Bầu cua tôm cá - Wikipedia
Bầu cua tôm cá (lit. 'gourd crab shrimp fish') is a Vietnamese gambling game using three dice. The game is often played at Tết (Vietnamese New Year).. Instead of showing one to six pips, the sides of the dice have pictures of a fish, a prawn, a crab, a rooster, a calabash gourd, and a stag. Players place wagers on a board that has the six pictures, betting on which pictures will appear.
en.m.wikipedia.org
. There will also be a side game of Tiến lên or thirteen for anyone interested. Candy will be provided but please bring some if you want (very encouraged).

Best,

MIT VSA
